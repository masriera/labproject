# PYTHON AND R LAB PROJECT 

## **TASK 2.1**
For the first part of the second task we proceeded with a data analysis based on the data set from task one (https://github.com/Claudiaimp/prlabproject). We continuing using the Python programming language and we refered to the matplotlib library to visualize our data and to the pandas library to manipulate data. In the graphical representation, the team tried to underline the main relationships between the most significant variables. 

### TASK 2.2
For the second part of the second task we changed both programming language and dataset. Using the R programming language we have done a data analysis on the dataset of the following repository https://github.com/Carlamaria99/Project-3-Luiss-BuscemiPonzianelliSciammarella3 regarding the IMDb API (an open movie database) for films ranging in the years 1999 to 2015. Data manipulation was done through the dplyr library while the data visualization with the ggplot2 library. The most significant variables identified during the analysis were: the year of release, runtime, genre, language and country of origin. The purpose of the analysis was to clearly represent the relationships that can arise between variables in general.
